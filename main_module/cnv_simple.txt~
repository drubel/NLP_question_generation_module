I have to be at a business conference at the Regents hotel. 
I am hoping that it is not very far away from here.
It is only a twenty minute drive from this hotel.
Book the taxi for one in the afternoon.
I will make the booking right away.

I will save your new number.
I am good, apart from all this rain!
