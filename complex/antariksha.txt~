Conversation between 2 friends hoping to help each other

Tim: Henry, what are you doing?

Henry: I have been trying to solve this physics problem for the last half hour, and I still have no idea how to do it.

Tim: When do you have to turn it in?

Henry: It is due at the end of this week.

Tim: Well, it is only Monday. Why don’t you get some after-school-tutoring tomorrow?

Henry: I have to sign up for it first. I guess I will go sign up for the Wednesday session tomorrow.

Tim: You should reread the chapter before you show up for the session. It will help you understand the subject matter better.

Henry: OK, I will do that.

Tim: Now that your problem is solved, I need you to lend me a hand with my problem.

Henry: What is up?

Tim: I need to build a new doll house for Nancy. I was putting her doll house away, and somehow I accidentally dropped it. It was broken into pieces.

Henry: How clumsy of you! Does she know?

Tim: I told her about it. I could not lie to her.

Henry: How did she take it?

Tim: My sister really liked that doll house, and obviously she was not very happy. But, I told her that I would build a better one for her. So, I need your help.

Henry: Me? Help you? I have never built anything in my life.

Tim: Me neither. But, don’t worry. Putting together pieces of wood is not going to be difficult.

Henry: It is more than just putting pieces of wood together. You need to put in windows and doors. Have you thought about how you would do that?

Tim: Who says houses need to have windows and doors?

Henry: So, you are going to build a doll house with no windows and no doors?

Tim: Yes, I do not see anything wrong with that. Do you?

Henry: No. It makes the project easier to handle now. But, are you sure that Nancy will not mind having a doll house with no doors and no windows?

Tim: Yes, I am sure.

Henry: Are you sure that Nancy will find this doll house with no doors and no windows prettier than the one you broke?

Tim: No, I am not sure. Why do you have to make things so complicated?

Henry: I am not trying to complicate things. You did tell Nancy that the new doll house would be better than the one you broke. I just want to remind you of your promise.

Tim: Ah, I wish I have not touched her doll house! What should I do then?

Henry: Get help from somebody who knows how to build a doll house. I would not be of any help to you in this project.

Tim: Who do you suggest I ask?

Henry: Mr. Brown used to be a carpenter. He will be glad to help you out. Why don’t you give him a call, and see whether he has some free time.

Tim: You are right. It will take us forever to build this doll house. With Mr. Brown’s help, I can finish it in no time.

Henry: OK, now that your problem is solved, can you help me trim the trees in the back yard?

Tim: Who? Me? Trim the trees in your back yard? It will take us ages to trim those trees. Let’s see who is good at trimming trees. Ah, you can ask Mr. Brown. He is also good at trimming trees. And, when you ask for his help, please ask him to help me build a doll house also.



Going to University conversation

John: Hey, James. What are you doing here?

James: I am looking for an apartment to rent. What are you doing here? Looking for an apartment also?

John: Yes. Since my parents’ house is so far away, I need to find an apartment closer to school. I

thought you were going to stay at the school dormitory.

James: I still have not decided whether to stay at the dormitory or not. I am looking at different options to find the cheapest lodging.

John: So, what are you looking for?

James: All I need is a place big enough for my bed, my desk and my television. Of course, the place should have a kitchen so that I can cook my meals. I will be living on a very tight budget and will have to watch every dime.

John: Me too. I cannot work full-time like I did during the summer. I will cut down on my workload in order to spend most of the time on my studies. So, a safe and decent apartment is all I need.

James: How long have you been looking?

John: I just started this week. Since school is going to start next month, I figured I better start the process as soon as possible.

James: It is not easy to find an apartment to your liking that does not cost a lot. I have been looking at the ads in the newspaper for two weeks, and I still have not found anything yet.

John: Really? Is it that difficult to find an apartment?

James: No, it is just that everything I like so far is too expensive and way beyond my reach.

John: Is it because they are very close to school? I heard that the closer they are to school, the higher the rental cost.

James: Maybe that is the problem. Since I do not have a car, I need to find something close to school.

 

John: Have you thought about sharing an apartment? If you want, we can find a two bedroom apartment and share it. It may be cheaper that way.

James: That could solve our problem.

John: Wait! Maybe we should talk this over before we decide.

James: Right. For this plan to succeed, we need to come up with some sort of agreement or set of rules.

John: Here is my first question: What do you do during the weekdays?

James: I have to work at Starbucks from 8:00AM to 12:00PM, and then I have school from 1:00PM to 5:00PM. After that I plan to go home, eat dinner, and work on my school assignments. How about you?

John: Well, I have class from 8:00AM to 10:00AM, and then I go to the library to work until 2:00PM. After that, it is school again until 4:00PM. I plan to stay on campus until 6:00PM to work on my computer projects, and then go home to work on my other classes’ assignments.

James: It is my turn to ask the second question. Do you plan to have your friends over at the apartment very often?

John: No, not on weekdays. I want to finish my homework during the weekdays as much as possible. I think half of my weekend will also be reserved for homework. If my friends do stop by, it will probably be during the weekend.

James: Good, I plan to do the same things during school time. I also plan to visit my parents during the weekend. My mom is a great cook.

John: My parents’ house is too far to visit once a week. I will go home to see them and my little brother during the holidays. I need to be happy with whatever foods I cook.

James: It seems that sharing an apartment with you may work. Do you want to try it?

John: Yes. Let’s go in and take a look at this one.
